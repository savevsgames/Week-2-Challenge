Welcome to the Software Development Boot Camp! This curriculum is broken down into three phases, with a group project at the end of each phase. Let's delve into what each phase covers and what students will create during the project weeks.

## What to Expect in Phase 1

The first part of the course focuses on the front end&mdash;the words, images, and forms you see and interact with in the browser. Students will learn about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and browser APIs.

## Project 1

Students will develop a complex client-side web application with a project team.

## What to Expect in Phase 2

The second phase of the course focuses on the back end and connecting it to the front end. Students will learn to work with Node.js and TypeScript, build servers and consume APIs, connect to databases, use generative AI and prompt engineering, and build a full-stack application using React on the front end.

## Project 2

Students will develop a complex full-stack application with a project team, creating a server-side API, adding a React front end and user authentication, and connecting it to a database.

## What to Expect in Phase 3

In the final phase of the course, students will learn how to make their applications more performant and efficient, working with NoSQL databases to build full-stack MERN applications. They'll also learn skills and topics vital to their roles in the workplace, including testing, CI/CD and automation, and object-oriented programming. Finally, they'll work with a second programming language, learning the fundamentals of Python.

## Project 3

Students will develop a complex full-stack single-page application with a project team, using either the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack or replacing Node.js and Express.js with a Python back end.
